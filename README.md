### LBBS-mLSTM
mLSTM was designed to solve the non-uniform time-series input data. It utilizes the time interval to modify the memory. Comparing with the traditional LSTM, the memory is adjusted with a larger amount of short memory and a fewer long-term memory. 
### Implementation 
tensorflow version 2.7.0

python 3.6.9
